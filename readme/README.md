This project has **two versions of the same code**:

- **C++ version** (for Arduino/ESP32)
- **MicroPython version** (for ESP32 or other boards that run MicroPython)

Both versions do the **same thing**:

- Use an ultrasonic sensor  
- Measure distance  
- Turn an LED on or off based on that distance  

The only difference is the **programming language**.

That’s it.
